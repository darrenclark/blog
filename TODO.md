# TODO

## Technical

- move blog to GH pages, built with Github Actions
- design improvements
  - code vs code w/ language styling inconsistent
  - h1 spacing after code could be increased
  - share links are kinda ugly/don't fit in - should I just replace it with a 'tweet this article' link?
- redesign?  Inspiration:
  - https://swift.org/blog/
  - https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2020/11/11/this-week-in-rust-364/
